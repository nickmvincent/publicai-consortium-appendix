"We find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society
to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS
leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to
$13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the
concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by
programming language and internal vs outward-facing programming efforts."
