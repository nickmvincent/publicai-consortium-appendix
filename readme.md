## Readme: a public ai consortium appendix

This repo holds a variety of documents that supplement and complement several papers and resources advocating for public AI. The goal is to provide an open forum for additional discussion.

Several rounds of feedback were also collected via Google docs.

## Canada as a Champion for Public AI

One such paper is "Canada as a Champion for Public AI: Data, Compute and Open Source Infrastructure for Economic Growth and Inclusive Innovation" from Nicholas Vincent (Simon Fraser University, School of Computing Science), Mark Surman (Mozilla), and Jake Hirsch-Allen (The Dais), currently available as an authors' working draft here:

This paper discusses the viability of a consortium approach to building public AI systems, and highlights unique ways that Canada is well positioned to contribute to this consortium in three areas: data, compute, and the open source stack (training code, evaluation code, and more).

Important ideas in the paper:

- Public AI is not about a government monopoly on AI; it's about building public goods that enable a robust ecosystem that support services deployed public bodies (e.g. a ChatGPT-style product) alongside non-profits, private companies, open source projects, and cmore.
- CERN and Airbus provide particularly salient success stories for multinational collaboration
